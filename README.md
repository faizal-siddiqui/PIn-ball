## Rule of the Game :-
  1. Register first, for, without registering you would not be able to see your score to leaderboard.
  2. Stop the ball from colliding the ball with boundry wall.
  3. If you are not able to do this for three times you will lose.
  4. If the system at the right side lose three times before you, you win.
  5. After every win, the level will be increased and the speed of the pin-ball will increase.
